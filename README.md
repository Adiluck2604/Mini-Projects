Mini Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my Mini Projects repository, This repository contains several simple yet elegant Python mini projects. Each project demonstrates modern problem-solving skills, optimized coding practices, and fundamental concepts in mathematics, data structures, and algorithms â€” all implemented in under 50 lines of clean and readable code.

## Projects Included

1. Classic Caesar Cipher:  
   A simple encryption algorithm that shifts letters by a fixed number of places. A great introduction to string manipulation and modular arithmetic.

2. Hangman:  
   The classic word guessing game implemented with control flow and basic data structures, showcasing logical thinking and user interaction.

3. Password Generator:  
   Generates secure, random passwords using character sets, incorporating randomness and user input validation.

4. Rock Paper Scissors: 
   A two-player game simulation illustrating conditional logic and input handling.

5. Treasure Hunt Game:  
   A fun, text-based adventure using only if-else statements to navigate choices, perfect for understanding branching and decision-making in programming.

How to Run the Projects: 
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project folder of your choice, e.g., `password_generator`, `hangman`, etc.
3. You can directly run this code by opening the file or folder in your pycharm, VScode or IDLE or you can also Run the Python script using the command in your terminal:
